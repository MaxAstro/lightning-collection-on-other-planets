# LCooP: Lightning Collection on other Planets

Allows lightning collectors (*not* lightning rods) to function on planets other than Fulgora, by giving lightning a chance to spawn around them at night. Chance is affected by coverage of the rod, distance to other rods, and the planet's magnetic field.
